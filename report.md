Geographic Distribution (by zip code)

![image](./images/affordable_units_by_zipcode.png)

We have used -0010 as a means of grouping together affordable housing that does
not have a listed zip code. This is a small number of units.

As we can observe, the three zipcodes with the highest number of affordable
housing units are 02129, 02127, 02210, 02130, 02115. These correspond to
Charlestown, South Boston, Seaport, Jamaica Plain, and South/East Fenway.

Interestingly, the highest ratio of rent/own units is to 02114, which is the
West End.
